My employer at the time Eurocom waved any copyright ownership of this code.

"
Eurocom Entertainment Software Limited, hereby disclaims all copyright interest in "Plisgo" written by Joe Burmeister.
"

Eurocom is no more. From it's ashes came Eight Pixel Square.
Eight Pixel Square was acquired by Outplay Entertainment.

The original licensing was:

"
The actural Plisgo Explorer namespace is GPLv3.
The example PlisgoFSLib client API implimentation is LGPLv3.
Plisgo_Dokan_Example is under the BSD license, do what you want with it.
"

But since it appears the copyright is mine, I wave it completely.
Consider it WTFPL or PD.

I hope someone finds something useful it.
